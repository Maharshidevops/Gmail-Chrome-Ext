# Gmail-Chrome-Ext
I have developed a lightweight Gmail extension designed to efficiently track all unread emails, read emails, and maintain a detailed Gmail activity record. The extension is simple to use, requires minimal resources, and is easy to install.
Installation Steps:
Download the extension files from my GitHub repository.

Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/.

Enable Developer Mode (toggle in the top-right corner).

Click Load Unpacked and select the extracted extension folder.

The extension is now installed and ready to use!
